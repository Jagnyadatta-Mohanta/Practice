# Melo Online Quiz System  
Front-End Development Project

---

## Project Description
The **Melo Online Quiz System** is a fully client-side web application developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The project was designed as part of a front-end development task to demonstrate practical skills in building interactive web applications, managing browser-based data storage, and implementing user-friendly interfaces without the use of any backend services.

The system enables users to attempt quizzes, receive real-time feedback, track scores, and store results persistently using **Browser LocalStorage**.
